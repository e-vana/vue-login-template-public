# Vue-Login-Template-Public

This application is a login and registration template that utilizes VueJS and ExpressJS.  There's some built in administrative functionality that will at some point be developed further to have some more tools.  This application allows users to create an account, get email confirmations of account creation, allows users to login and allows users to reset their passwords.

## Getting Started

Download the repository and unpack.  There are two primary folders, the 'Client' folder and the 'Server' folder which are the front end and back end, respectively.  

### Prerequisites

You'll need to write some environment variables with all of the essential keys to properly use this application.

Vue CLI uses several different .env files for different environments.  The front end utilizes '.env.development' and '.env.production'.

in /client/.env.development
```
#The address and port number of the back end Express server, default is 3000
VUE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
#The name of the front end application
VUE_APP_NAME="Your App Name"
```

in /client/.env.production
```
#The deployment URL, I use Heroku for deployment, will look something like https://yourAppName.herokuapp.com
VUE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
#The name of the front end application
VUE_APP_NAME="Your App Name"
```

The Express server also has an environment file, these will be what variables you use for development.  In the Heroku dashboard we overwrite these variables for the production variables.

in /server/.env
```
#This variable is your remote mongo string, I use a free MLAB database and create a user on it.  Inside of the MLAB dahsboard there will be a connection string to copy.  Will look something like 'mongodb://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@dsXXXXXX.mlab.com:XXXX/XXXXX'
DB_URL=""

#A random string of numbers and letters to use as a json webtoken secret
JWT_SECRET=""

#In development, this will be the address of the front end when you run 'npm run serve' from the front end.  Will look like 'http://localhost:8080'.
APP_URL=""

#Application name, used on emails generated by nodemailer
APP_NAME=""

#This application uses nodemailer and an outlook account to send emails.  You can change the provider type inside of the 'sendEmail.js' methods if you don't want to use Outlook.  This is not a sure fire way to send emails but it does generally work, they get flagged for spam a lot by most big email providers though.  This is something that needs to be changed at some point, but seemed good enough for proof of concept.

EMAIL_USER=""

Email_PW=""
```

### Installing

We need to run NPM installs in both the front end and back end folders.

From the project root,
```
cd client
npm install
```
From the project root,
```
cd server
npm install
```

After you've created the proper environment variables and run npm installs, you can start the application.

In Client directory,
```
npm run serve
```

In Server directory,
```
nodemon
```
You should see a "database connected" message in console if the application connected to the remote database and started succesfully.

## Deployment

In the project root, you'll notice a package.json file.  This file is used by heroku to run the same setup as above but includes a client build step to generate the front end files for the express server to serve.  This allows the front end and server to be hosted on the same Heroku deployment.  You could separate these out if you wanted to scale the backend and front end differently within Heroku, but it's much easier to have one repository to deploy.

Be sure to change your deployment variables within Heroku!
